# The file to assist adding new fidl interfaces in SkipBlock service.
# Some rust sources in vendor/google repository requires implementation
# of all fidl interfaces in the SkipBlock service. However, currently
# we don't have a way for cross repository submission. With the
# feature.gni file, it is possible to add new interfaces without breaking
# the build with the following steps.
#
# 1. Add implementation of the new interface in the rust sources first,
# but exclude them from compilation using conditional compilation,
# i.e. #[cfg(foo)]. The flag is expected to be read from feature.gni file.
#
# 2. Implement the fidl interface in fuchsia directory. Define the
# required flag in feature.gni file.
